			<p> We created the original NoveLite in 2014 when our founder 
				realized that even after 20 years, there were still no drop-in 
				modular options for the average person to use their GameBoy in 
				the dark. Then, we realized – if something as popular as the 
				gameboy doesn’t have any good options for backlighting yet, then 
				surely lots of other devices don’t either. We started work right 
				away to make a version for the Playdate and the rest was history. 
				Our light kits feature user-servicable interchangeable parts, 
				entirely solder-free and tool-less installation, and clear, easy to 
				read instructions. The best part? If we don’t currently have a model 
				for your device, contact us. We’ll work with you to create a unit that 
				works for you, and share it so that the entire community can 
				benefit. Our kits are made to order and tested before they 
				ship. Are you ready for a truly novel light?
